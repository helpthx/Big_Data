#### Course base

# Resource attributes

Since resources across the internet vary in terms of their pre-requisites and general accessibility, it is useful to
give attributes to them so that it is easy to understand where a resource fits into the wider machine learning scope. Below is a few suggested attributes (please extend):
 
 - :blue_book: = Doing
 - :heavy_check_mark: = Completed
 - :rainbow: = creative
 - :bowtie: = beginner
 - :sweat_smile: = intermediate, some pre-requisites
 - :godmode: = advanced, many pre-requisites


#### Tools Used

### Accelerated Learning Techniques
- Watch videos at 2x or 3x speed using a browser extension
- Handwrite notes as you watch for memory retention
- Immerse yourself in the [community](https://medium.com/@exastax/top-20-data-science-blogs-and-websites-for-data-scientists-d88b7d99740)
