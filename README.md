# Resource attributes

Since resources across the internet vary in terms of their pre-requisites and general accessibility, it is useful to
give attributes to them so that it is easy to understand where a resource fits into the wider machine learning scope. Below is a few suggested attributes (please extend):
 
 - :blue_book: = Doing
 - :heavy_check_mark: = Completed
 - :rainbow: = creative
 - :bowtie: = beginner
 - :sweat_smile: = intermediate, some pre-requisites
 - :godmode: = advanced, many pre-requisites
